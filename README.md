# templateEngine
Software engineering team generator command line application.
In this application, the user will be able to create an entire software engineering team through command line prompts. Using the Inquirer NPM, the user can answer questions based on the selected roles and then an html file will be created which will show the entire software engineering team in a visually appealing interface.

This application requires extensive use of Inquirer and also Jest which allows us to test various aspects of classes created for this application. I believe the application will be a very useful template in the future..
